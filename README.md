Python Flask Backend - Question 1:

Create a simple Flask API with two endpoints. The first endpoint should accept a JSON object containing a list
of numbers and return the sum of the numbers. The second endpoint should accept a JSON object containing
two strings and return the concatenated result. Demonstrate error handling for invalid input.

Python Flask Backend - Question 2:

Implement a simple user authentication system using Flask. Create an endpoint for user registration that
accepts a username and password, stores them in a dictionary (as a stand-in for a real database), and returns
a success message. Then create an endpoint for user login that checks if the provided username and
password match the stored values, and if so, returns an &quot;access granted&quot; message; otherwise, return an
&quot;access denied&quot; message.

ReactJS Front-end - Question 1:

Create a simple React app with two input fields and a submit button. The first input field should accept a string
and the second should accept a number. On clicking the submit button, display the inputted string repeated the
number of times specified in the second input field, in a new paragraph below the form. Ensure proper
validation and error handling for the inputs.

ReactJS Front-end - Question 2:

Implement a simple to-do list application in React. The application should allow users to add and delete
items from the list. The list items should be stored in the component&#39;s state. Demonstrate the use of
React hooks to manage state and handle user actions.
